# cGAN for Feature Engineering

The main idea is to generate new and realistic fetures based on labels. GANs are excellent at generating realistic data. We can condition this generation by using [Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784)

Refer to [Jupyter notebook](notebook) to see how this can be done.
